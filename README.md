SimDirs
=======

Quick and dirty app to display Xcode 6 simulator names and open their locations.

This is not fancy at all. The new way that Xcode names simulator folders doesn't make it easy to see what's what so I made this thing. SimDirs displays a list of device names / OS versions. Double-clicking an entry opens the location in the Finder.

That's it.
